            Hello, viewer of source! For application instructions, execute "hireMe()" in the JavaScript console.

            <h1>Apply to Urban Airship's Web Team!</h1>

            <h2>First, send us a request.</h2>
            <p>
                Send an HTTP POST request to
                <code><span class="url-origin"></span>/api/candidates</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your first request will fail, but the response will tell you how to fix it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you succeed, the response will include a unique identifier.
            </p>

            <h2>Next, write a cover letter.</h2>
            <p>
                Tell us why you'd like to work with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Include your unique ID and the source code or command-line invocation you used to send your POST request. That might make
                your cover letter long. That's okay!
            </p>

            <h2>Finally, submit your cover letter with your application.</h2>
            <p>
                Complete the application process wherever you found the posting that led you here.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll get back to you as soon as we can!
            </p>
